### Announcing a new site for WARP documentation!
Exome Germline Single Sample documentation has moved! Read more about the [Exome Germline Single Sample Pipeline](https://broadinstitute.github.io/warp/docs/Pipelines/Exome_Germline_Single_Sample_Pipeline/README) on the new [WARP documentation site](https://broadinstitute.github.io/warp/)!

### Exome Germline Single Sample summary
The Exome Germline Single Sample pipeline implements data pre-processing and initial variant calling according to the GATK Best Practices for germline SNP and Indel discovery in human exome sequencing data. For a broad overview of the pipeline processes, read the GATK Best Practices documentation for [data pre-processing](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360035535912) and for [germline short variant discovery](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360035535932).
